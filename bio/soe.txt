Secrets of Eternity was released in January 2015. This set introduced the
Infernoids, a series of monsters that can special summon themselves to the
field by banishing other infernoids from the hand or graveyard. Other notable
cards in this set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort 
Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe-Shaddoll Fusion, and a card that bolstered
Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss-Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight
Constellar Diamond.
