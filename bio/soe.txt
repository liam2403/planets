Secrets of Eternity was released in January 2015. This set introduced the
Infernoids, a series of monsters that can special summon themselves to the
field by banishing other infernoids from the hand or graveyard. Other notable
cards in this set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort 
Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe-Shaddoll Fusion, and a card that bolstered
Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss-Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight
Constellar Diamond. In this series both Nyhmnim and myself will open 24 packs,
or 1 box, of a core Yu-Gi-Oh! booster set. We will build a deck and play a best
2 out of 3, and the winner will receive a small prize to uprgade their deck.
HOWEVER! Each episode, we will open another box of the next set that was 
releaed moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading out decks before 
dueling each other at the end of each episode. This is the Yu-Gi-Oh! 
Progression Series.
